# Semantic_Text_similarity_graph
 A tool that constructs a graph given text in a natural language as input, such that a node represents a sentence, and an edge exists from one sentence (node) to another if text similarity between the two is above a user-defined threshold.
 
 # Tools
 
  1- NetworkX: provides a variety of features for working with graphs
  
  2- Sentence transformers: are a family of pre-trained language models that are specifically designed for sentence-level tasks. They are based on the Transformer architecture, which is a neural network architecture that   
   has been shown to be very effective for natural language processing tasks.
  
  3- Matplotlib: provides a variety of features for creating visualizations.
